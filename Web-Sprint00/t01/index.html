                    <td>The Soul Stone ranks as possibly the most dangerous of all the
                        Infinity Stones, with it holding a special standing among the
                        others. The sacrifices for the Stone are
                        permanent and irreversible, as not even the omnipotent
                        combination of the Six Stones could resurrect them. The Soul
                        Stone has the ability to manipulate the soul, the essence that
                        makes up an individual, and has the ability to resurrect and
                        conjure the spiritual representation of the people who are
                        dead.</td>

                    <td>As the Infinity Stone that represents, describes and governs
                        over the flow of time, the Time Stone is among the most powerful
                        artifacts in all existence. Due to its power, it cannot be
                        held and used by anyone not powerful enough to withstand it,
                        thus forcing Agamotto to create the Eye of Agamotto as a
                        container to allow other sufficiently advanced sorcerers to
                        wield it.</td>

                        the Space Stone grants the wielder absolute control over space itself. 
                        It is primarily used to open portals to other locations and can even allow interdimensional travel. 
                        As one of the six Infinity Stones, the Space Stone ranks as among the most powerful artifacts in the universe, 
                        with Black Widow saying it has the power to wipe out an entire planet.</td>

                        over the hearts and minds of others. Like with all the other
                        Infinity Stones, it is among the most powerful artifacts in
                        all existence.</td>

                        the Reality Stone granted its user absolute control over reality
                        itself. However, like all other Infinity Stones, due to it being
                        the most powerful artifact in existence, it can only be wielded
                        by beings of sufficient power and inside beings of no powers,
                        it will inevitably kill them, as evidenced with Jane Foster.

                        destructive forces of the universe, the Power Stone grants its
                        wielder tremendous energy manipulation capabilities. Due to the
                        amount of energy the Power Stone releases, it is the most
                        destructive out of all the Infinity Stones in terms of raw
                        power.</td>
